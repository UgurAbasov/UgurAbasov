We began with the NOT gate, which we completed in approximately five minutes. Building on this momentum, we progressed to more complex gates, starting with the AND gate. This proved challenging, but through persistence and teamwork, we accomplished it successfully. The OR gate followed more smoothly, as our prior experience allowed us to adapt our approach with only minor modifications.

For the NAND gate, we expanded our collaboration by partnering with another team, which proved highly effective. The most ambitious undertaking was the XOR gate, which required coordination among four teams and approximately thirty minutes to complete.

Throughout this process, we encountered significant challenges, particularly in wiring connections and verifying each one for accuracy. Despite these difficulties, the experience was highly rewarding. We gained valuable insights into efficient teamwork and demonstrated our collective ability to achieve complex technical objectives.
